  <h2>Childhood</h2>
  I grew up in a large family in the south of Kazakhstan in the city of Taraz.
  I am the third child of my parents. As I had 7 siblings, it was never boring at home. My father was a civil servant, and mom was a kindergarten teacher.
  Since childhood, my parents have created many conditions for their children to develop diversified.
  We had a lot of activities over the weekend. For instance, playing cards, tennis, football, table soccer, badminton &amp etc.
  From an early age I loved to swim, and every summer vacation we had our family trip to sea.
  I can say that I had a wonderful childhood.

  <h2>Educa&#769;tion</h2>
  <p>
    In my hometown,I have studied in primary school for 5 years, then continued my education in KTL and graduated in 2020.
    During my school years, I was interested in mathematics and participated in several Olympiads, but, unfortunately, there was no result.
    After that, I began to study English in depth. Took part in an international debate competition and won 7 gold, 6 silver medals &amp a cup.
    Then I passed the IELTS exam for admission to the university, at that time I wanted to enter NU. It was hard for me to decide on a profession.
    However, after graduating from high school, I eventually decided on a career choice, and it was a cybersecurity specialist.
    I graduated from Astana IT University, and now I'm studying for a master's degree at MIT. I have completed an internship in Google.
    And also I created a game, it might be simple, but no less interesting.Here is the game link &#8209; <s> <a href="https://play.unity.com/p/5fb8db9936a1ec05508aeb1b">Walking Ted</a></s>.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    My favourite activity in my free time is sleep. I found this very useful. Other thing that I like to do is singing, when no one is around.
    I read a lot, but now I lost my interest to this activity. Still my favourite genre is detective, especially the books of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie_bibliography">Agatha Christie</a>.
